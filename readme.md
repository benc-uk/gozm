# Z Machine Implementation in Go

This repository contains an implementation of the Z Machine, a virtual machine designed for running text adventure games, in the Go programming language. The Z Machine was originally developed by Infocom for their interactive fiction games.

This is EXTREMELY early work-in-progress. The goal is to create a fully functional Z Machine interpreter that can run classic Infocom games as well as other Z Machine-compatible titles.

The target is to support Z Machine version 3 only at this time.
