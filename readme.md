# GOZM – Go Z-Machine Runtime

GOZM is a Z-Machine interpreter written in Go with a focus on version 3 story files. It now executes real games end-to-end (tested with the bundled Infocom classics and custom Inform 6 stories) while keeping the codebase approachable for anyone curious about the architecture of the original Infocom virtual machine.

## Current Status

- Runs Z3 story files via a terminal frontend (`impl/terminal`) with blocking input, status line updates, and buffered output.
- Opcode coverage includes branching, routine calls, stack and object tree handling, text decoding, abbreviations, and dictionary lookup logic as required by V3.
- Command-line debug levels (`-debug 0|1|2`) expose instruction tracing and state dumps to aid reverse engineering and spec validation.
- Comprehensive guide material documents the journey from bytecode loading to full execution.

## Features

- Z-Machine v3 focused interpreter core with structured call stack and object model support.
- Story loader that validates headers, decodes packed addresses, and hydrates initial game memory from Z3 files.
- Text decoding pipeline (ZSCII, abbreviations, dictionary lookup) shared by interpreter and tests.
- Terminal UI providing synchronous input and display, suitable for playing stories directly in the shell.
- Optional debug tooling: instruction tracing, breakpoint hooks, opcode filtering, and pre-generated memory dumps under `misc/` and `test/`.

## Project Layout

- `internal/zmachine/` – machine runtime: instruction dispatch, call stack, object tree, I/O hooks.
- `internal/decode/` – helpers for unpacking V3 headers, operands, and text (abbreviations, ZSCII tables).
- `impl/terminal/` – CLI runner that wires stdin/stdout to the interpreter and exposes debug flags.
- `impl/web/` – experimental WASM entry point for a browser UI (under active development).
- `docs/spec/` & `docs/guide/` – annotated spec excerpts and a tutorial series documenting implementation details.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25 or newer.
- (Optional) Inform 6 compiler and UnZ tooling if you want to build the sample `.inf` sources yourself.

### Build the CLI Runner

```bash
go build -o bin/gozm ./impl/terminal
```

### Run a Story

```bash
./bin/gozm -file stories/minizork.z3
```

Add `-debug 1` for single-step logging or `-debug 2` for instruction traces. The repository ships with several Infocom-compatible story files under `stories/` and compiler fixtures under `test/` for quick smoke testing.

You can also execute directly with `go run ./impl/terminal -file test/core.z3` during development.

### Make Targets

`make build` compiles the terminal binary, `make run STORY=minizork` launches a bundled game, and `make story STORY=scratch` rebuilds the matching Inform 6 source and dumps the generated bytecode.

## Design Notes

- Instruction Dispatch: `internal/zmachine/step.go` implements the fetch-decode-execute loop keyed by opcode tables defined for V3. Branching helpers live alongside operand decoding for clarity.
- Memory Model: `internal/zmachine/machine.go` loads the packed story into RAM, maps dynamic/static ranges, and surfaces helper methods for address translation.
- Text Handling: `internal/decode/decode.go` maps ZSCII to UTF-8 and surfaces abbreviation expansion used both by the interpreter and tooling.
- IO Abstraction: `internal/zmachine/external.go` defines interfaces so alternative frontends (WASM or scripting) can supply custom input/output streams without altering the core.

For a narrative walkthrough of these pieces, start with the tutorial series:

- [Part 1 – The core](docs/guide/part-01.md)
- [Part 2 – Basic program execution](docs/guide/part-02.md)

More chapters are planned as work continues on streams, save/restore, and alternate frontends.

## Roadmap

- [x] Branching, arithmetic, stack, call/return, and object tree opcodes.
- [x] Abbreviation tables and ZSCII decoding.
- [x] Terminal input pipeline.
- [ ] Output streams (screen/logging) per spec.
- [ ] SAVE/RESTORE/RESTART handling.
- [ ] WASM frontend with persistent state and browser IO.
- [ ] Regression test suite driven by official specification transcripts.
